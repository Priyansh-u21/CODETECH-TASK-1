OVERVIEW OF THE TEMPERATURE CONVERSION PROGRAM



PURPOSE:

The program converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Users can input a temperature in one scale and get the converted temperatures in the other two scales.

STRUCTURE:

1.	Functions:

    o `celsiusToOthers(double temp)`: Converts a temperature from Celsius to both Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
  	
    o `fahrenheitToOthers(double temp)`: Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to both Celsius and Kelvin.
  	
    o `kelvinToOthers(double temp)`: Converts a temperature from Kelvin to both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
  	

   
     
  	

   
3.	Main Function:
	
     o	Displays a menu for the user to select the temperature scale of the input temperature.
  	
     o	Takes the user's choice and the temperature to convert.
  	
     o	Calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice.
  	
     o	Prints the converted temperatures.
  	

   
DETAILED BREAKDOWN:

1.	Menu Display and Input:
	
    o	The program starts by displaying a menu with three options for conversion: from Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.
  	
    o	The user inputs their choice (1 for Celsius, 2 for Fahrenheit, 3 for Kelvin).
  	
    o	If the choice is invalid (not 1, 2, or 3), the program prints an error message and exits.
  	

   
2.	Temperature Input:
   
     o	After a valid choice is made, the program prompts the user to enter the temperature value to be converted.
  	

   
3.	Conversion and Output:
   
     o	Based on the user's choice, the program calls the corresponding function to perform the temperature conversions.
  	
     o	The chosen function calculates and prints the converted temperatures with a precision of two decimal places.
   



   PROGRAM FLOW:

   
1.The user is greeted with a menu to choose the temperature scale they want to convert from.

2.The user inputs their choice.

3.The user is prompted to enter the temperature value to be converted.

4.The program performs the conversion and prints the results.

5.The program terminates.
